## About

I'm Kristofer Berggren, a software developer based in
[Singapore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), and this is my 
personal webpage.

I'm currently working as a senior software engineer with
[Blackmagic Design](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/) in the
[Digital Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema) industry,
developing the video post production software
[DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve).

Before that I worked in the 
[AIDC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_and_data_capture) 
industry at [Honeywell](http://www.honeywell.com/), developing firmware and 
software for 
[thermal barcode printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_printing) 
products.

Prior to that I did software engineering contracting/consulting in the 
automotive industry through [Semcon](http://www.semcon.com/), doing 
concept/research development in areas like engine controls 
([HCCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_charge_compression_ignition)) 
and active safety systems 
([collision avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_avoidance_system)), 
for clients such as [Volvo Cars](http://www.volvocars.com/) and 
[Saab Automobile](http://www.saabcars.com/).

Further details on my professional background can be found on my 
[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristoferberggren).

I do some programming in my spare time, and most of my personal projects are
open sourced and published under my [GitHub account](https://github.com/d99kris).
